PicoKeys
========

A small macro keyboard using a [RPi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/). Originally made to help someone that had been in a car accident and had (hopefully temporary) limited use of her fingers. The original problem was that her work laptop required pressing CTRL-ALT-DELETE to login, which she couldn't do with only 2 working fingers. This board solved that with 1 key and left 15 more for other conviences.
